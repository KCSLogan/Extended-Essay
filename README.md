# Extended-Essay
----------------
A Python program as a numerical solution to a simple Earth-moon 3-Body problem, written for my IB extended essay to test the equations derived in it.

To use, please install the file locally and run on your python IDE (IDLE works fine). The program will not work online (such as on repl.it) because most online IDEs do not support the video objects used in pygame.

Note:
 - pygame may need to be installed using pip3 on your computer as it may not be a default package on your IDE. 
 - Decreasing dt to too small values may decrease the accuracy of the simulation, depending on your processing power.
